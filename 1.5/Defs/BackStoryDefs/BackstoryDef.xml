		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was born in a shelter controlled by a cult within the Defense Council. [PAWN_pronoun] was once used as a gestation pod, but during a raid on the shelter by the Economic Security Department for Special Periods, [PAWN_pronoun] and [PAWN_possessive] infant were trapped in the wreckage.
 By the time others found them, [PAWN_possessive] infant had already died from illness. In [PAWN_possessive] madness, [PAWN_pronoun] sacrificed [PAWN_possessive] own arm to the cult in exchange for [PAWN_possessive] child's life. In the end, all [PAWN_pronoun] received was a rag doll.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] is responsible for guarding documents in a library within a bunker of the Defense Council. This job should be performed by adults, but all the adults in the shelter have been sent to war as soldiers. In principle, [PAWN_pronoun] shouldn't look at the contents, but [PAWN_possessive] curiosity led [PAWN_objective] to make a mistake.
 [PAWN_pronoun] came across criticisms of totalitarian states from before the disaster, and even the most terrifying regimes in history seemed to [PAWN_objective] like an ideal state. This prompted [PAWN_objective] to start contemplating the definition of what is right.</description>
